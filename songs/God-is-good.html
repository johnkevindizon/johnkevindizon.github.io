    Chorus:
        D                     Bm                                                             
    God is good all the time
            G                                    A  
    He put a song of praise in this heart of mine
        D                     Bm                                                             
    God is good all the time
                    G                                    A  
    Through the darkest night, His light will shine
              G              A              D     G    D  
    God is good, God is good all the time

    Verse1:
            A                                  Bm
    If you're walking through the valley
        G                   Bm   A
    And there are shadows all around
        F#m                        Bm  
    Do not fear, He will guide you
          G                              A 
    He will keep you safe and sound
    Em                        A
    He has promised to never leave you
          Em                         G            A
    Nor forsake you, and His word is true

    Verse2:
              A                        Bm
    We were sinners and so unworthy
        G                    Bm   A 
    Still for us He chose to die
        F#m                        Bm  
    He Filled us with His Holy Spirit
          G                              A 
    Now we can stand and testify
    Em                  A
    That His love is everlasting
          Em                           G          A
    And His mercies, they will never end

    Bridge:
    D/C#        Bm                      F#m    
    Though I may not understand
        Em                            Am7
    All the plans you have for me
    Bb                     F
    My life is in your hands
                          Em        D/F# 
    And through the eyes of faith
      G         A
    I can clearly see
