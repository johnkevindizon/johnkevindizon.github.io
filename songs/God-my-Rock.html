    Chorus:
    D                                       
    You are the strength of my heart
    A
    You are the strength of my heart
                  Bm                      G
    I can rely on You, I can rely on You

    Verse1:
                    D                  
    When my heart is overwhelmed
    I will look to You alone
                    Bm                                        G
    God my rock, God my rock, God my rock
                      D
    You will stand when others fall
    You are faithful through it all
                    Bm                                        G
    God my rock, God my rock, God my rock

    Pre - Chorus:   
                              A
    In the blessing, in the pain
                                      G                         
    Through it all You've never failed me

    Chorus:
    D
    You are the strength of my heart
    A
    You are the strength of my heart
                  Bm                   G
    I can rely on You, I can rely on You
    D
    You are the joy of my life
    A
    You are my song in the night
                   Bm                            G
    No other love so true, Jesus, I trust in You
    
    Verse2:
                      D                  
    When I've struggled to believe
    You have not let go of me
                    Bm                                        G
    God my rock, God my rock, God my rock
                      D                  
    Carried through the darkest storms
    You have held me in Your arms
                    Bm                                        G
    God my rock, God my rock, God my rock
