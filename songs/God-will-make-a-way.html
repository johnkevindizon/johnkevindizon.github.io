    Chorus1:
    F                            C                             Bb                       F
    God will make a way where there seems to be no way.
          Bb                             F/A              Gm                                    C                   
    He works in ways we cannot see, He will make a way  for me.

    He will be my guide, hold me closely to His side,
              Bb                                  F/A                    Gm                                                       
    With love and strength for each new day, He will make a way,
    Bb        C            F           D                      		                                                      He will make a way.

    He will make   a  way.

            Eb                       F                           Bb  
    By a roadway in the wilderness He'll lead      me,
            Eb            F                         G
    And rivers in the desert will I see.
    C                      D/C
    Heaven and earth will fade,
            Bm        B/D#     Em
    But His word will still remain;
    C          D                                Esus4    E
    He will do something new today.
