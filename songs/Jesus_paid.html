    Intro:
    Capo 6th 
    C   F    Dm7   F
    Verse1:
    C          
    I hear the Savior say
              G                                  C
    Thy strength indeed is small
                  Am                                 F
    Child of weakness, watch and pray
                C               G        C
    Find in Me thine all in all
    Chorus:
    C                     Am
    Jesus paid it all
    Em7              G
    All to Him I owe
    C/E                   F          
    Sin had left a crimson stain
          C                G             C
    He washed it white as snow
    Verse2:
    Lord, now indeed I find
    Thy power and Thine alone
    Can change the leper's spots
    And melt the heart of stone

    Verse3:
    And when before the throne
    I stand in Him complete
    Jesus died, my soul to save
    My lips shall still repeat

    Bridge:
          C                                  F       
    Oh, praise the One who paid my debt
            Dm7                           F
    And raised this life up from the dead
