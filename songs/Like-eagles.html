    Verse:
    F             C                              Gm
    O my soul, do you not know?
                                      C
    Have you not heard?
                    F                             Dm
    It's been told from the beginning
            Gm                           C 
    The Lord your God is on your side

    F              C                           Gm
    O my soul, don't be afraid
                              C
    Hope in the Lord
                F                               Dm
    By His righteousness and power
                Gm                           C
    He will strengthen, He will guide

    Chorus:

                    F                    Dm
    And I will soar on wings like eagles
    Gm                     C            
    Held by the hand of God
              F/A                 Dm
    I will run and not grow tired
              Gm                     C            
    When on His name I call

                    F                    Dm
    For the Lord is never weary
            Gm                     C            
    His ways are beyond my thoughts
            Dm        Gm     
    I will trust in Him
              C          F
    With all my heart
