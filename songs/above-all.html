    Above all nature
                    G   
    And all created things
        D/F#    Em
    Above all wisdom
            D                         C     G/B
    And all the ways of man
    Am7        
    You were here
        G                         D/F#
    Before the world began
    Verse2:
    G/B          C	      D        
    Above all kingdoms
      G   
    Above all thrones
    G/B          C	      D        
    Above all wonders
                    G

    There's no way to measure
              B7
    What You're worth

    Chorus:
    G       Am7  D/F#                 G
    Crucified, Laid behind a stone
    G       Am7  D/F#                 G
    You lived to die, Rejected and alone
    D/F#   Em    D                            C        G/B
    Like a rose, Trampled on the ground
                            Am7   G/B                  C    D
    You took the fall, And thought of me
      G
    Above all
