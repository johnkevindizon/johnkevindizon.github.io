    Intro:    
    Am7   D   G  

    Verse1:
                            G                                  C         Am7
    God sent His son, they called Him Jesus;
                          G    Em7          Am7    D     
    He came to love, heal and forgive;
                          G                         C         Am7
    He lived and died to buy my pardon,
                      G                            D                            G
    An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives!

    Chorus:
        D/F#         G                            C 
    Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
                          G    Em7            Am7   D     
    Because He lives, all fear is gone;
                          G  G7                     C    Am7
    Because I know He holds the future,
                      Dsus2    
    And life is worth the living,
    D                          G
    Just because He lives!

    Verse2:
                              G                          C         Am7
    How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
                          G    Em7          Am7    D     
    And feel the pride and joy he brings;
                          G                      C         Am7
    But greater still the calm assurance:
                            G                        D                            G
    This child can face uncertain days because He Lives!

    Verse3:
                            G                            C         Am7
    And then one day, I'll cross the river,
                          G    Em7          Am7    D    
    I'll fight life's final war with pain;
                          G                                C         Am7
    And then, as death gives way to victory,
                      G                       D                          G
    I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives!
