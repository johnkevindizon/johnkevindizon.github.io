    Verse1:
    A                                      D   
    These are the days of Elijah
    A                      E                    A
    Declaring the word of the Lord
    A                                                      D   
    And these are the days of Your servant Moses
    A                        E                     A
    Righteousness being restored
          C#m                                         F#m7
    And though these are days of great trial
        Bm7              D                      E
    Of famine and darkness and sword
    A                                                 D   
    Still, we are the voice in the desert crying
    A                            E                  A
    "Prepare ye the way of the Lord!"

    Chorus:
                        A                                  D
    Behold, He comes riding on the clouds
                                A                                  E
    Shining like the sun at the trumpet call
                    A                                   D
    Lift your voice, the year of jubilee
                                  A           E          A
    And out of Zion's hill, salvation comes

    Turn:    
    A   D   A   E

    Verse2:
            A                                      D
    And these are the days of Ezekiel
            A                    E                    D
    The dry bones becoming as flesh
            A                                             D
    And these are the days of Your servant David
        A                E                 A
    Rebuilding a temple of praise
            C#m                                     F#m7
    Oh, these are the days of the harvest
                  Bm7              D                      E    
    For the fields are as white in Your world
            A                                                 D   
    And we are the laborers in Your vineyard
    A                      E                     A
    Declaring the word of the Lord!

              A                      G                 D        A
    Who was and who is and who is, to come
              A                      G                 D        A
    Who was and who is and who is, to come
