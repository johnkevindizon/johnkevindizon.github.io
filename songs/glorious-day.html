    Dwelt among men, my example is He
                                    E                                         G#m

    His glory revealed

                        G#m                                E
    Buried, He carried my sins far away
                      B                           F#
    Rising, He justified freely forever
                            G#m
    One day He's coming
                                E                            B        E

    One day they nailed Him to die on a tree
                          E                                    B    
    Suffering anguish, despised and rejected
                              E                                   C#m
    Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He
                                          E                                              G#m
    Hands that healed nations, stretched out on a tree
                                            F#
    And took the nails for me

    One day the grave could conceal Him no longer

    One day the stone rolled away from the door
                          E                                    B    
    Then He arose, over death He had conquered
                              E                                   C#m
    Now He's ascended, my Lord evermore
                                        E                                            G#m
