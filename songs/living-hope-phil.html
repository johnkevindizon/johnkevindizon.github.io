    Verse1:
                              D                                A        
    How great the chasm that lay between us
                              G        Bm                    A        
    How high the mountain I could not climb
                  D                               A        
    In desperation, I turned to heaven
                                  G          A                   D        
    And spoke Your name into the night
                                    G                                     D/F#                
    Then through the darkness, Your loving-kindness
                                  Bm7                    A         
    Tore through the shadows of my soul
                        D                                 A        
    The work is finished, the end is written
              G                A               D        
    Jesus Christ, my living hope

    Verse2:
                        D                                A        
    Who could imagine so great a mercy?                          
                                    G     Bm                              A        
    What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
                        D                                            A        
    The God of ages stepped down from glory
                          G           A                D        
    To wear my sin and bear my shame
                              G                        D/F#                
    The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
                        Bm7                         A         
    The King of kings calls me His own
                    D                                 A        
    Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
              G                A               D        
    Jesus Christ, my living hope

    Chorus:
            G  D                       A                            Bm7
    Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
          G  D                        A                            Bm7
    Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
                    G                       D 
    You have broken every chain
                      A                        Bm7
    There's salvation in Your name
              G                A               D        
    Jesus Christ, my living hope

    Verse3:
                              D                                          A        
    Then came the morning that sealed the promise
                          G       Bm               A        
    Your buried body began to breathe
                      D                                  A        
    Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
                            G                     A              D        
    Declared the grave has no claim on me

                              D                                          A        
    Then came the morning that sealed the promise
                          G       Bm               A        
    Your buried body began to breathe
                      D                                  A        
    Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
                            G                     A              D        
    Declared the grave has no claim on me
              G                   A        D     
    Jesus, Yours is the victory!
