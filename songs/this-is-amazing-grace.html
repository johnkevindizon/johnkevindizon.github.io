    Who breaks the power of sin and darkness?
    C
    Whose love is mighty and so much stronger?
    Em                            D                           C C 
    The King of Glory, the King above all kings
    G
    Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder?
    C
    And leaves us breathless in awe and wonder?
    Em                            D                           C C 
    The King of Glory, the King above all kings

    This is unfailing love
                                                Em
    That You would take my place
              D
    That You would bear my cross
              G
    You laid down Your life
                C
    That I would be set free
        Em                        D
    Oh, Jesus, I sing for
    All that You've done for me

    Who brings our chaos back into order?

    Who makes the orphan a son and daughter?
    Em                            D                           C C
