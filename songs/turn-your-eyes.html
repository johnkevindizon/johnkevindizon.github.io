    G                           Bm7                 C            Am7

    And see Christ the Lion awake
    G                           Bm7                 Em            C
    What a glorious dawn, fear of death is gone
                G/D         D                G
    For we carry His life in our veins

    ‘All glory to Jesus alone!’
